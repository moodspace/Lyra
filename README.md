A modern-looking Spotify ad-blocker

This program is based on EzBlocker on GitHub. You can view its code here at https://github.com/Xeroday/Spotify-Ad-Blocker.
However, only the core features were retained. I build this new program using WPF & C#, with many improvements on the original work. The goal is not only for users to enjoy an ad-free Spotify, but also a goal to enhance user experience in using the program itself.
There is no schedule for a final release except for source code. I will release executable files when the trunk becomes stable. Currently, there are still many bugs, like recovering from blocking. These bugs are common after the migration from WinForm to WPF.
